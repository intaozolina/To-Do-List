## Hi!
### This is my latest project of To Do List.

<p> To my this project I used Vue 3 and Composition API, for global state there is used Vuex and SCSS for styling.</p>
<p>In this App you can add tasks to do by using input area. You can edit, hide and delete each separate task, also you can show all tasks (including hided ones).</p>

<sub>P.S. to run code locally - use 'npm run serve' in your terminal or open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser</sub>

<h5>
See how it works!
